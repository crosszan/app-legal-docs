# GrowMate Privacy Policy

[**View in Chinese**](growmate-zh.html)

1. **Introduction**
   GrowMate ("the App") is operated by **CrossZan** and is committed to safeguarding the data of parents and their families. This policy explains how we handle the information you keep on your device, our promise not to collect remote data, and the rights you may exercise at any time.

2. **Data We Collect**
   - The App does **not** transmit, upload, or sync any data to us or third parties.
   - Everything you enter in the App—such as baby profiles, growth records, or logs—stays on your device under your full control.

3. **How We Use Data**
   - All features rely on the data you record locally, and that data never leaves your device.
   - Personalized settings and logs exist solely to render features on your device; we never use them for advertising, profiling, or other secondary purposes.

4. **Data Storage and Security**
   - **Local storage**: App data only resides on your device, and we cannot view or access it remotely.
   - **Optional iCloud sync**: when you enable iCloud at the system level, Apple encrypts and stores the synced data under your Apple ID; we never hold a copy.
   - **Access control**: we recommend enabling a device passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to prevent unauthorized access.

5. **Third-Party Sharing**
   - The App does not share your data with any third party.
   - If you choose to use iCloud Family Sharing or similar system features, Apple handles that exchange entirely; we neither participate in nor can we access it.

6. **Children’s Privacy**
   - The App is designed for parents or guardians to manage infant data; we do not proactively request information from children.
   - If you discover a child submitted data without permission, contact us and we will help delete it.

7. **Your Rights**
   - **Access and export**: view all records in the App and export them with the system sharing tools.
   - **Correct and delete**: edit or delete baby profiles, logs, and reminders at any time; deleting a profile removes its associated data.
   - **Permission management**: revoke notification, photo, or other permissions through system settings whenever you wish.
   - **Opt-out and data deletion**: uninstalling the App or clearing its iCloud data immediately stops our access.

8. **Updates to This Policy**
   - We may update this policy due to feature changes or legal requirements and will highlight updates inside the App or on the website; continued use after an update means you accept the changes.
