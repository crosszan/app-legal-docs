# GrowMate Terms of Use

[**查看中文版本**](growmate-terms-zh.html)

1. **Acceptance of Terms**  
   By using GrowMate (the “App”) you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy. If you are acting on behalf of a minor, you must have valid guardianship authority and remain responsible for how the App is used.

2. **Local Storage and iCloud Sync**  
   The App does not require an account. All baby growth records are stored locally on your device by default. If you enable Apple iCloud, synchronization occurs only within your Apple ID and is governed by Apple’s iCloud terms. GrowMate cannot access or control iCloud and does not guarantee availability, accuracy, or security of the sync service.

3. **Features and Limitations**  
   The App provides logging, reminders, and related utilities; it does not deliver medical advice, diagnoses, or a substitute for pediatric professionals. Evaluate your records independently and consult healthcare providers when needed. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any feature as required.

4. **User Obligations**  
   - Ensure that all inputs and materials you store are lawful and do not infringe third-party rights.  
   - Do not misuse the App, attempt to reverse engineer it, exploit security vulnerabilities, or engage in unlawful, malicious, or destructive activity.  
   - Maintain the security of your devices and create your own backups to prevent data loss.

5. **Intellectual Property**  
   GrowMate and its affiliates own all rights to the software, interface, graphics, text, and trademarks within the App. You receive a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the App for lawful, personal purposes. You may not copy, sell, rent, or otherwise exploit the App without authorization.

6. **Disclaimer**  
   The App is provided “as is.” To the extent permitted by law, GrowMate disclaims all warranties and is not liable for direct or indirect damages arising from data loss, sync failures, device issues, or reliance on information recorded in the App.

7. **Indemnification**  
   You agree to indemnify and hold harmless GrowMate, its affiliates, and employees from any claims, damages, or expenses arising out of your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

8. **Changes and Termination**  
   We may update these Terms or modify the App at any time. Material changes will be communicated in-app or on our website, and your continued use constitutes acceptance. If you disagree with the updated Terms, discontinue use and uninstall the App.

9. **Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**  
   These Terms are governed by the laws of GrowMate’s operating entity. Disputes must first be addressed through good-faith negotiation; if unresolved, they fall under the jurisdiction of the courts where the operating entity is registered.

10. **Contact**  
    For questions, contact email dev@crosszan.com (example address).
